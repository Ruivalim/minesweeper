# Minesweeper

## Sumary

This project has the only purpose of practicing JavaScript, and IA Skills.

Everyone knows what minesweeper is, my objective here is first develop a functional implementation of the game with JavaScript, latter on start development of IA to solve it. Starting with classic IA based on algorithm, then creating a machine learning to solve it.

## To Do List

### Game

- [X] Generate GRID
- [X] Fill tiles with bombs
- [X] Fill tiles with hints
- [ ] Stylize tiles
- [ ] Clicked tiles to open
- [ ] Open white spaces
- [ ] Mark tile with flag
- [ ] Winning/Defeating behaviour

### Classic IA with Algorithm

### IA with Machine Learning
