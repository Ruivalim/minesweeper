# Minesweeper

## Sumary

This project has the only purpose of practicing JavaScript, and IA Skills.

Everyone knows what minesweeper is, my objective here is first develop a functional implementation of the game with JavaScript, latter on start development of IA to solve it. Starting with classic IA based on algorithm, then creating a machine learning to solve it.

[See example](https://ruivalim.github.io/minesweeper/example/)
